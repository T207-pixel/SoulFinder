# soulFinderA
Web app for commiting rescue operations in finding people.

You have to setup JDK20, create postgresql db on your pc (configure in properties file url, username, password as it demands your db) and you have to update pom.xml "mvn compile" for updating maven dependecies. After that it's easy to run project from Intellij IDEA Community or you may use this command to run project from command line "./mvnw spring-boot:run".
